"""
Thoughts:
  for a simple function like this, my work here is pretty over-engineered.
  I did it this way to "showcase my proficiency".
  However, in a real-world scenario, I would have just written the function and moved on.
  Though a function like this in the real world would much more likely be a method in a class.
  In that case I would have had logging and error handling in the higher level methods calling this function.
  and my tests would have more likely focused around that class.
